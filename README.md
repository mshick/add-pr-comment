A GitHub Action which adds a comment to a pull request's issue.

This actions also works on [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues),
[issue_comment](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#issue_comment),
[deployment_status](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#deployment_status),
[push](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push)
and any other event where an issue can be found directly on the payload or via a commit sha.

## Features

- Modify issues for PRs merged to main.
- By default will post "sticky" comments. If on a subsequent run the message text changes the original comment will be updated.
- Multiple sticky comments allowed by setting unique `message-id`s.
- Optional message overrides based on job status.
- Multiple posts to the same conversation optionally allowable.
- Supports a proxy for fork-based PRs. [See below](#proxy-for-fork-based-prs).
- Supports creating a message from a file path.

## Usage

Note that write access needs to be granted for the pull-requests scope.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        with:
          message: |
            **Hello**
            🌏
            !
```

You can even use it on PR Issues that are related to PRs that were merged into main, for example:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        with:
          message: |
            **Hello MAIN**
```

## Advanced Uses

### Proxy for Fork-based PRs

GitHub limits `GITHUB_TOKEN` and other API access token permissions when creating a PR from a fork. This precludes adding comments when your PRs are coming from forks, which is the norm for open source projects. To work around this situation I've created a simple companion app you can deploy to Cloud Run or another host to proxy the create comment requests with a personal access token you provide.

See this issue: https://github.community/t/github-actions-are-severely-limited-on-prs/18179/4 for more details.

Check out the proxy service here: https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment-proxy

**Example**

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        with:
          message: |
            **Howdie!**
          proxy-url: https://add-pr-comment-proxy-94idvmwyie-uc.a.run.app
```

### Status Message Overrides

You can override your messages based on your job status. This can be helpful
if you don't anticipate having the data required to create a helpful message in
case of failure, but you still want a message to be sent to the PR comment.

**Example**

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        if: always()
        with:
          message: |
            **Howdie!**
          message-failure: |
            Uh oh!
```

### Bring your own issues

You can set an issue id explicitly. Helpful for cases where you want to post
to an issue but for some reason the event would not allow the id to be determined.

**Example**

> In this case `add-pr-comment` should have no problem finding the issue number
> on its own, but for demonstration purposes.

```yaml
on:
  deployment_status:

jobs:
  pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - id: pr
        run: |
          issue=$(gh pr list --search "${{ github.sha }}" --state open --json number --jq ".[0].number")
          echo "issue=$issue" >>$GITHUB_OUTPUT
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        with:
          issue: ${{ steps.pr.outputs.issue }}
          message: |
            **Howdie!**
```
