# add-pr-comment

> A GitHub Action which adds a comment to a pull request's issue.

## Features

- Fast, runs in the GitHub Actions node.js runtime; no Docker pull needed.
- Modify issues for PRs merged to master.
- Multiple posts of the same comment optionally allowable.
- Supports emoji üòÇüòÇüòÇ!
- Supports a proxy for fork-based PRs. [See below](#proxy-for-fork-based-prs).
- Supports creating a message from a file path

## Usage

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        with:
          message: |
            **Hello**
            üåè
            !
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repo-token-user-login: 'github-actions[bot]' # The user.login for temporary GitHub tokens
          allow-repeats: false # This is the default
```

You can even use it on PR Issues that are related to PRs that were merged into master, for example:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          message: |
            **Hello MASTER**
          allow-repeats: true
```

## Proxy for Fork-based PRs

GitHub limits `GITHUB_TOKEN` and other API access token permissions when creating a PR from a fork. This precludes adding comments when your PRs are coming from forks, which is the norm for open source projects. To work around this situation I've created a simple companion app you can deploy to Cloud Run or another host to proxy the create comment requests with a personal access token you provide.

See this issue: https://github.community/t/github-actions-are-severely-limited-on-prs/18179/4 for more details.
